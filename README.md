# Financial-Analytics

This project was on P&G as part of my course assessment in which I have calculated Simple moving average and exponential moving average to identify the trend direction of a stock or to determine its support and resistance levels. Also, I applied a financial statistical model that is monte carlo simlulation to understand the effect of uncertainty and randomness in forecasting models.
